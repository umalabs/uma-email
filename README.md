# UMA Email

A prototype implementation of the Authorization-Enhanced Mail System (AEMS) draft proposal, working as a proof of the concept of CAZ.

AEMS provides a mechanism to store, share and transfer information across security domains. From the user's point of view, AEMS looks like a standard email system.
